	abstract = {While ecosystem-based fisheries management calls for explicit accounting for interactions between exploited populations and their environment, moving from single species to ecosystem-level assessment is a significant challenge. For many ecologically significant groups, data may be lacking, collected at inappropriate scales or be highly uncertain. In this study, we aim to reconstruct trophic interactions in the Norwegian Sea pelagic food-web during the last three decades. For this purpose, we develop a food-web assessment model constrained by existing observations and knowledge. The model is based on inverse modelling and is designed to handle input observations and knowledge that are uncertain. We analyse if the reconstructed food-web dynamics are supportive of top-down or bottom-up controls on zooplankton and small pelagic fish and of competition for resources between the three small pelagic species. Despite high uncertainties in the reconstructed dynamics, the model results highlight that interannual variations in the biomass of copepods, krill, amphipods, herring, and blue whiting can primarily be explained by changes in their consumption rather than by predation and fishing. For mackerel, variations in biomass cannot be unambiguously attributed to either consumption or predation and fishing. The model results provide no support for top-down control on planktonic prey biomass and little support for the hypothesised competition for resources between the three small pelagic species, despite partially overlapping diets. This suggests that the lack of explicit accounting for trophic interactions between the three pelagic species likely have had little impact on the robustness of past stock assessments and management in the Norwegian Sea.},

	abstract = {"Plausible" consumer-resource models, based on energetic reasoning and allometric empiricism, are formulated and their dynamics investigated. Most of the parameters in these models are determined by the body sizes and metabolic categories (endotherm, vertebrate ectotherm, invertebrate ectotherm, or plant) of the populations in question. The remaining parameters have clear biological meanings. The intent of these models is to provide maximum realism from minimum data when needed because of constraints of time or of resources for empirical research. The models also demonstrate the influence of physiological power and body size on consumer-resource dynamics. For a given metabolic type, we define ecological scope as the ratio of maximal ingestion rate to respiration rate. Invertebrate ectotherms have greater ecological scope than do vertebrate ectotherms, which have greater scope than do endotherms. Greater ecological scope implies ability to subsist on scarcer resources and a tendency to more stable dynamics. Changes in dynamics associated with increased resource carrying capacity K (the "paradox of enrichment") are investigated. Robust limit cycles (sustained oscillations) require a Type III functional response, but even in this case the cycles quickly "implode" (with respect to changes in K) to extremely small densities if the resource-consumer body mass ratio is too high. Estimates are given for resource-consumer body mass ratios that permit robust limit cycles, and some pertinent data are discussed. An analytic expression for the periods of limit cycles is derived. In terms of body mass, the periods scale as (consumer body mass)1/8 (resource body mass)1/8.},

	doi = {10.1086/381872},
	abstract = {For at least 200 years, since the time of Malthus, population growth has been recognized as providing a critical link between the performance of individual organisms and the ecology and evolution of species. We present a theory that shows how the intrinsic rate of exponential population growth, rmax, and the carrying capacity, K, depend on individual metabolic rate and resource supply rate. To do this, we construct equations for the metabolic rates of entire populations by summing over individuals, and then we combine these population-level equations with Malthusian growth. Thus, the theory makes explicit the relationship between rates of resource supply in the environment and rates of production of new biomass and individuals. These individual-level and population-level processes are inextricably linked because metabolism sets both the demand for environmental resources and the resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction. We use the theory to make explicit how and why rmax exhibits its characteristic dependence on body size and temperature. Data for aerobic eukaryotes, including algae, protists, insects, zooplankton, fishes, and mammals, support these predicted scalings for rmax. The metabolic flux of energy and materials also dictates that the carrying capacity or equilibrium density of populations should decrease with increasing body size and increasing temperature. Finally, we argue that body mass and body temperature, through their effects on metabolic rate, can explain most of the variation in fecundity and mortality rates. Data for marine fishes in the field support these predictions for instantaneous rates of mortality. This theory links the rates of metabolism and resource use of individuals to life-history attributes and population dynamics for a broad assortment of organisms, from unicellular organisms to mammals.},
