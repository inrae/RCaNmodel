<NAME VERSION AND AUTHORS>		
Model Name	modelname	 Title/name of the food-web model
Model Version and date	modelversion	 Specific code used to uniquely identify the model version
Authors	authors	 Names and addresses of the principal investigators associated with the food-web model development
<DOMAIN AND UNITS>		
Domain coverage	domaincoverage	 Geographical and temporal extent of the model.
Time unit	timeunit	 Time-step used in the model, e.g. daily, weekly, quarterly, annually.
Biomass units	biomassunit	 Main unit for biomasses and fluxes (e.g. tonnes fresh weight, thousand tonnes, tonnes/km2, gC/m2, etc.)
<COMPONENTS>		
Components within the model domain	componentsin	 List of the trophospecies within the model domain and a description of how they were defined, e.g. are these taxonomic species? Are some divided by developmental stage or are several species grouped under a single trophospecies? Are there trophospecies that are split by geographical areas? Indication of relevant sources of data and information.
Components outside the model domain	componentsout	 List of the components outside the model domain, e.g. primary production, source/sink of migration from/to other regions, fisheries. Indication of relevant sources of data and information.
<FLUXES>		
Trophic links	trophicflux	 List of the trophic links and a description of how these were defined/selected. Trophic links are from prey to predators. Indication of relevant sources of data and information.
Non-trophic links	nontrophicflux	 List of the non-trophic links and a description of how these were defined/selected. Non-trophic links are e.g. import, export, migration, production or other transfer of biomass that are not ingested by a predatory group. Indication of relevant sources of data and information.
<INPUT PARAMETERS, DATA AND CONSTRAINTS>		
Input parameters	inputparam	" Source of information (datasets, references, experimental results, theory-based, other models, [Ellipsis]) used to derive EACH input parameter values (i.e. AssimilationE,	Digestibility,	OtherLosses,	Inertia,	Satiation and	RefugeBiomass for each trophospecies within the model domain)."
Observation series	observations	 Description of individual time-series, including units, source of information (surveys, assessments, [Ellipsis]) and doi when available.
Constraints	constraints	 Sources of information used to define the user-defined constraints used in the model (i.e. outside satiation, inertia, positive fluxes and Biomass>Refuge Biomass, which are implicit constraints in all RCaN models).
<UNCERTAINTIES AND LIMITATIONS>		
Species Exhaustivity	uncertspeciesexhaus	 How well does the list of trophospecies cover the biomass of all species within the model domain? Could/should more species be added?
Species Homogeneity	uncertspecieshomog	 For each trophospecies, are all individuals sharing the same set of prey, predator and input parameters? Could/should some trophospecies be split to reflect intra-group variations?
Species Parameters	uncertspeciesparam	 How (un)certain are the input parameter values? Could other values be used?
Components outside the model domain	uncertcompoutside	 How (un)certain is the information about external entities. Could/should these be formulated in alternative ways?
Trophic links	uncerttrophiclinks	 How (un)certain and how stable/variable are the trophic links? Are some links known to exist but not included in the model? Are some links rarely observed or known to be complicated to observe (e.g. no hard parts to identify certain prey)? Are some links highly variable between years/ares/studies?
Non-trophic links	uncertnontrophiclinks	 How (un)certain and how stable/variable are the non-trophic links? Are some links known to exist but not included in the model?
Constraints	uncertconstraints	 How (un)certain are the constraints? Could/should certain constraints be relaxed/strengthened/removed/added?
Time series Availability	uncertts	 Are the time-series privately available and documented? Could more time-series be added? Are the time-series updated and maintained? Are the time-series covering the model domain appropriately (in time and space)? Are the time-series provided with appropriate uncertainty estimates? Are there additional time-series available? Are there conflicting time-series?

Project identity	projident	 Title or name of the research project under which the food-web model was developed.
Project Period	projper	 Period during which the research project was conducted (start-end)
Project Objectives	projobj	 Scope and purpose of the research project
Project Abstract	projabst	 Descriptive abstract of the research project
Project Funding	projfund	 Grant and contract numbers, names and addresses of funding sources
