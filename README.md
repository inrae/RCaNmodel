## What is CaNmodel aimed at? Statement of need
RCaNmodel and RCaNmodelconstructor primarily aim at implenting food-web models based on a
Chance and Necessity approach. Details and relation with pre-existing tools can be found in 
the statement of need of this [document](paper/paper.md).
As a summary, those model focus on trophic exchanges between preys and predators while accouting
for the intrinsic stochasticity of nature and the existence of physical laws. The R package RCaNmodel 
facilitates the modelling process (model construction and validation, model exploration, output analysis),
while the RCaNconstructor GUI provides an interactive/intuitive interface to support 
a participatory framework.
